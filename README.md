# oscp-tools
My collection of scripts I've developed in my time during OSCP labs and the exam. 

For some third-party scripts I have used as a main part of my arsenal, I have redacted the code but included a link to the original.

Includes "darkforest", originally a separate project, with the purpose of streamlining the initial enumeration as well as build up an interactive knowledge base. Left as a (working) prototype for the discovery of a ready well developed tool fulfilling a similar purpose.
